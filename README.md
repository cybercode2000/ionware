### Hello there,
I'm Adedeji Stephen, and I see you stumbled on my GitHub profile.

### So, who am I, and what I do?
I'm a software engineer fascinated by the magical land called the Web. I build stuff and solve problems —and that means doing it the right way —clean code architecture, elegant design patterns, blah blah blah, I'm a fanatic. Oh! I love clean and well-designed code; I drool over it —[Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) codebase is an example.
